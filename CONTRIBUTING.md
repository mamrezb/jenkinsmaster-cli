## Code Style

Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency:

1. **Go Code**:
   - Use `go fmt` to format your code.
   - Follow idiomatic Go practices.

2. **Terraform Modules**:
   - Use clear and descriptive variable names.
   - Ensure all variables are documented in the `README.md` for the module.

3. **Ansible Playbooks**:
   - Follow YAML best practices.
   - Use roles and modules appropriately to keep playbooks modular and reusable.

## Testing

Testing is critical to ensure stability and maintainability. Before submitting a pull request:

1. Run all existing tests to ensure your changes donâ€™t break anything:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```
2. If adding a new feature or fixing a bug, include tests that validate the behavior.
3. Verify integration with Terraform and Ansible where applicable.

## Pull Request Process

To ensure a smooth PR review process:

1. Ensure your PR title is descriptive and references any related issues (e.g., "Fix: Address nil pointer exception (#42)").
2. Provide a clear description of what the PR does, including screenshots or logs if applicable.
3. Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch: 
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
4. Address any feedback promptly during the review process.
